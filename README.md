Title: Face Swapping with InsightFace

Description:

This Python application utilizes Hugging Face's InsightFace library to swap faces between two images. It leverages pre-trained models for face detection and face swapping, allowing for easy experimentation.

Features:

    Detects faces in two separate images.
    Swaps the detected faces between the images.
    Optionally displays the original and swapped images for visual verification.

Requirements:

    Python (tested with version 3.x)
    Hugging Face Transformers library
    InsightFace library (installable via pip install insightface)
    OpenCV-Python (for image processing)
    matplotlib (for plotting)
    NumPy (for numerical operations)

Installation:

    Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies.

    Install the required libraries using pip:
    Bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Usa el c贸digo con precauci贸n.

    Note: Create a requirements.txt file in your project directory with the list of requirements mentioned above.

Usage:

    Save two images (image1.jpg and image2.jpg) in the same directory as your script (app.py).

    Run the script from the terminal:
    Bash

    python app.py

    Usa el c贸digo con precauci贸n.

Explanation of the Code (app.py):

The provided code defines functions for:

    Initializing the FaceAnalysis application and face swapper model.
    Reading images and detecting faces.
    Swapping faces and optionally displaying the results.

Further Customization:

    Modify the swap_n_show function to customize the plotting behavior or add functionalities like saving the swapped images.
    Explore other functionalities offered by InsightFace for advanced face manipulation tasks.
